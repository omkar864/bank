# Genkit Google AI API Key (if using Genkit with Google AI plugin)
GOOGLE_GENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_GOOGLE_GENAI_API_KEY_HERE

# ImageKit URL Endpoint (Optional, for LoanApplicationForm image uploads)
# If you are not using ImageKit, or a similar service for image uploads handled by the frontend,
# the form will just send the file name, and the backend function needs to handle this (e.g., by ignoring if no real URL is expected).
# Example: NEXT_PUBLIC_IMAGEKIT_URL_ENDPOINT=https://ik.imagekit.io/your_imagekit_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_IMAGEKIT_URL_ENDPOINT=https://ik.imagekit.io/your_imagekit_id_or_placeholder

# NOTE: Firebase client config (API Key, Project ID etc.) is hardcoded in /src/lib/firebase/clientApp.ts
# as per current setup. If you switch to environment variables for client Firebase config,
# you would add NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_... variables here.
